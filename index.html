            <p>Daily status reports look into the day-to-day development of a project and to monitor whether is it complete according to plan or there is a delay for some reason. It is a useful tool to monitor if something implements smoothly or if there are certain factors which might affect performance. Daily Status Report is to give our clients a complete view of each dayâ€™s activities, accomplishments, or roadblocks. This level of reporting allows project managers to gain immediate insight into the project progress and evaluate if additional resources need to be used, know if the deadline will be met, and quickly attack any problems as soon as they happen. The report has multiple tabs to give both a high level, executive summary and detailed information into all areas of the project such as test case execution, defect analysis, test design (if applicable), and downtime.</p>
